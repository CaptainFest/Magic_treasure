# Magic_treasure

In a far away country, a magic treasure is hidden in a labyrinth surrounded by magic walls, which is, in
turn, lost in jungles. Centuries ago, mighty magicians and wealthy dictators tried to take the treasure
away, but the labyrinth resisted. The treasure still waits for someone really powerful and clever to come.<br>
Fortunately for the brave souls, an ancient artifact exists, which, when delicately asked, can tell the
distance to the labyrinth or, when inside the labyrinth, the distance to the treasure if using a shortest
way through the labyrinth. However, it was used so many times that only 2967 attempts has remained:
after the last attempt is answered, this artifact will turn into a latest iPhone, or whatever is appropriate for the current civilization.<br>
Sometimes magic is forceless once technology comes. When a similar labyrinth, which was known to hide
an oilfield, was approached by military forces, it was found that the outer magic walls of the labyrinth
are infinitely thin and lose their defensive power at four kilometers of altitude. So a brave soul can enter
the labyrinth, provided it can fly high.<br>
The Pnacotic Manuscripts hint that the labyrinth is organized as a lattice of size M × N (1≤M, N ≤ 50), where each cell is a 10×10 meter square. Some cells are free, and some are occupied by infinitely heavy magic cubic blocks. The treasure is invisible and lies in one of the free cells, at integer coordinates. <br>
You now reside in a tiny village somewhere near the labyrinth. You are equipped by a modern quadcopter
that can fly 10 kilometers horizontally away from your location, and can, of course, fly high enough to
surpass the magic walls. The ancient artifact is now mounted at the bottom of the quadcopter, and at
one click of the remote controller you can activate the artifact and get to know:<br>
 • if outside the labyrinth: the distance to the closest outer wall of the labyrinth, in meters.<br>
 • if inside the labyrinth: the length of the shortest path to the treasure, avoiding the cubic blocks.<br>
Unfortunately, the artifact does not know that it is activated in the air, and returns the distance to
the treasure as if it fell down and lies on the ground. That’s how magic works, you know.
Find the treasure!
